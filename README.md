# Matlab-Checkers
This project was made with Ernie Yates.

Please take this code and improve it. Commenting may not be the best because this was created for a school assignment.

To run the code as is download the entire folder and run **Checkers.mlappinstall** then run the app from the toolbar.
To test your changes run **startPoint.m**


The unused board called **taken** logs the potential taken pieces by all moves.


**RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS**

  **movement**
  - By checking moves from every possible position you could eliminate invalid moves. Would reccomend to create a moves class and have a loop track the moves with updated boards for each iteration. note:this will be quite tedious.
  **graphics and user interface**
  - Add deleted pieces to the sides of the board. Allow said pieces to be replaced onto the board.
  - Add button to show the rules again
  - Adjust text and button sizing
  **game speed**
  - The logic to determine if a piece can be moved is quite bloated
  **gameplay**
  - An AI would be fun to see
